<div id="ideaforcreating">
    <p>The idea to create this App was conceived recently when i had to compare code which used Javascript
        I was assessing the works of my peers and juniors which was mainly in React, Vue, Nodejs and similar.
        So when i tried to compare the files in many online and offline websites and softwares, I found Almost
        All those were very inaccurate and unadvanced to handle with what i was looking for, So i decided to 
        Build code that can suffice my expectations and this is how this App was created.
